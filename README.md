# Order App

This is a basic order application that creates shipments for orders. It uses Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, and Sass.

The form at the top allows users to choose from a list of vendors and corresponding orders and to input the destination address and a tracking number. Below that is a tab selector to see late shipments, shipments out for deliver, and unshipped orders.

Features that could be added are User Authentication and an Order form to create orders, as well as changes to some models once more data is needed and improvements to styling.
